According to some very rough number crunching on 201803 data from [StatCounter](http://gs.statcounter.com/browser-version-market-share), worldwide browser usage by page views indicates web design should be prioritized in the following way (until the data indicates otherwise):

1. 59.13% Chrome (& Android)
2. 14.77% Safari
3. 07.18% UC Browser (if you care about the Chinese viewership)
4. 05.20% Firefox
5. 03.40% Opera
6. 03.11% Internet Explorer (moves up to fourth at 05.21% if grouping with Edge's 01.91%)
7. 02.63% Samsung Internet
8. 04.34% other (including Edge's 01.91%, otherwise 02.43%)

Mobile vs. PC usage is nearly a toss-up at 45.63% and 49.99% respectively, but this particular dataset is based on the browser and not the device.  Browsers that don't have separate versions for mobile and PC get lumped into one or the other.  The remaining 02.89% is attributed to alternatives such as tablets, iPod Touch, and game consoles.  The missing 0.05% was probably lost due to rounding.

Seems fair to say let's focus on the top six in the list and focus on PC and mobile.
